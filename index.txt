About me

Who is Antonio?

I am passionate, first and foremost, about music—listening to music, to be clear. Despite my attempts to play the guitar, I haven’t quite mastered it (well, maybe a little), but certainly not at the level of Satriani, Santana, or Jimi Hendrix hahaha.

I love languages; they were my great passion for several years of my life. I learned to speak English, French, Portuguese, and German, but now, due to work and limited time, I only use English. As a result, my skills in the other languages have declined noticeably. I haven’t forgotten them, but it’s harder for me to form sentences that used to feel very easy. However, it’s nothing that can’t be regained with a bit of consistent practice.

I’ve always been very tech-savvy, as from a young age, my dad would bring home desktop computers with games on 3.14-inch floppy disks—wow, can you imagine? He would set me up with tasks on the PC to pass the time. He taught me how to type without looking at the keyboard and also how to input numbers the same way. Thanks, Dad, for instilling positive habits in me—like that and also the love of reading and education. Because of you, I never get tired of studying or learning new things every day.
